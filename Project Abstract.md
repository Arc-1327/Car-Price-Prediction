# Used Car Price Prediction Project Abstract:
## Problem Statement:
* The used car market in India is highly dynamic, with prices varying widely due to factors such as the car's make and model, mileage, condition, and current market trends. This variability often makes it challenging for sellers to determine accurate pricing for their vehicles.
## Objective:
* To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a used car based on its features.
## Proposed Approach:
* We aim to create a machine learning model trained on a dataset of used cars sold on Cardekho.com in India. This model will use car-specific features to predict prices accurately, enabling sellers and buyers to make informed decisions.
## Benefits:
* Accurate Pricing for Sellers: Sellers can set realistic prices, helping them sell their cars faster and achieve better returns.
* Competitive Pricing for Buyers: Buyers will have access to fairly priced options, enhancing their purchasing experience.
* Market Efficiency: The overall efficiency of the Indian used car market will improve with standardized pricing predictions.
