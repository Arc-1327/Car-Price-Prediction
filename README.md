# Used Car Price Prediction
## Overview
This project develops a data-driven predictive analytics solution that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast used car prices accurately. 
The system takes into account key features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, vehicle age, etc 
as input variables. By combining sophisticated data processing techniques with a user-friendly interface, the solution 
delivers valuable and precise pricing insights for consumers.
