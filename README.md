# Used Car Price Prediction
## Overview
This project develops a data-driven predictive analytics solution that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast used car prices accurately. 
The system takes into account key features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, vehicle age, etc 
as input variables. By combining sophisticated data processing techniques with a user-friendly interface, the solution 
delivers valuable and precise pricing insights for consumers.

## Features
* **Machine Learning Model**: Uses Gradient Boosting Regressor for accurate price predictions.
* **Data Analysis**: Explores key factors like brand, mileage, fuel type, and vehicle age.
* **Feature Engineering**: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
* **Model Evaluation**: Compares Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
* **Web App Deployment**: Built with Streamlit for real-time car price estimation.
* **Real-World Use**: Helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships make informed decisions.

## Usage  
1. **Open the Web App**: [Car Price Prediction](https://car-price-prediction-2kevc4iyv5vrexssiocuoz.streamlit.app/)
